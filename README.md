## One Week at a Time

**This is a full stack web application that is intended to help folks with weekly planning by allowing users to add tasks, and schedule them on an ongoing basis.**

This project was originally aimed to help me expand on my React skills. This means that the backend is in need of refactoring and bug fixes, as I was focussing primarily on frontend development here.
