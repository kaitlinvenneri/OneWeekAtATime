### Milestone 1

<b>Goals:</b>

1) Create a backend server for the web application
2) Connect the backend server to a database (MySQL)
3) Create server endpoints for the frontend to call, once implemented
4) Have endpoints create, read, update, and delete data in the database
5) Design and implement an initial data schema and endpoints for the first application features.

<b>Results:</b>

1) All goals were accomplished and can be viewed as issues corresponding to Milestone 1
2) The backend server is implemented using Node.js and Express.js
3) The database is implemented using MySQL
4) The frontend will be implemented using React.js (in Milestone 2)

Feedback: 
> Improvements can be made with regards to preventing the server from attempting to input invalid data into the database. This improvement will be 
incorporated in Milestone 2. This may involve specifically error handling and providing user feedback upon trying to send invalid data to the server endpoints.
